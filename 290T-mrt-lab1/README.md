Download the [synchronized brainwave dataset](http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~nick/synchronized-eeg.csv) (101MB) to a directory called `data/`.

Follow the prompts in the jupyter notebook, filling in the places marked with "TODO."

You can submit your assignment in two ways:
1. Fork this repository and commit changes to your fork. Submit a link to your repo on BCourses.
2. Submit a .zip file of this working directory on BCourses.

PS: The dataset comes from our [synchronized brainwave dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/berkeley-biosense/synchronized-brainwave-dataset). Feel free to puruse this Kaggle page for ideas on extra credit work.

Good luck, and have fun!
